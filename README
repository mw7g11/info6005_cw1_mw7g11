Notes: After useing dh_make to generate the debian folder, the debian new maintainers guide and google is very helpful to modify the essential files under it. When packaging, the lintian helps me to solve two problems(cannot put the source code files under '/share' and '/etc' directly.). After several times trying, it works finally!
